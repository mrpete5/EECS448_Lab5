	<p>Humans have called me a cave monster, but I go by Fred. Much of my time is spent defending my home. 
	During winter I just sleep, but I have to keep watch in the summer. The good humans feed me snacks they 
	leave behind while running away. One time, before I got rid of a human, he showed me the world wide web. 
	Since then I often visit the web sites listed below.<br></p>
